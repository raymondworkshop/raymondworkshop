Hi, I'm Raymond ZHAO Wenlong. I am a Technical Product Specialist in HK now.   
I like building products, teams, and ourselves. 


I was a Technical Officer in HSUHK, RA (in Chinese University of Hong Kong, City University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Baptist University), and Lead Software Engineer in Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia Corporation) and HKCREO (a Fintech startup).


If you’ve got any questions, suggestions or would like to discuss a project then email me at **bestraymond@icloud.com**. I’d be happy to hear from you. 

You can support my work by tipping me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/muyun), or send me some BTC at this address: 0xe555a409fe692879ca248970b673275010fc1ea9 .
